The entire month of April has officially been in lockdown across the world. The whole world is grappling with this COVID-19 pandemic. The adjustments to everyday life have become less scary as they have become so familiar. It has not been easy by any means. This storm has challenged everyone in so many different ways. We feel the changes and the struggles differently yet all have a common ground of unknown.

I have struggled in adjusting where some days are simply better than others. Feeling productive, accomplished, happy and good about my life have not been the dominate theme day in and day out. Instead I find myself getting frustrated, annoyed, complacent, and just unsure about what exactly I am supposed to be doing with myself.

Admittedly these feelings have been present my whole life as I internally questioned what direction I was supposed to choose for my life. Work and relationships would often get in the way and distract me as I went along. I would get caught up in the moment, the circumstances and think that some magical day in the future everything would just work out and clarity would find me. Yet now I have been sitting home for a month and a half with all the time to reflect.

I have cried, gotten mad, and even wanted to just run away at times but right now there is really no place for me to run to and get away from it all. We all have to sit with our demons whatever they may be. It is in this time that we have to make a choice. Do I remain the same or take the time, effort, and very hard work to confront my past and its challenges that have shaped me?

I think deep down we all want more from ourselves. We all want to feel like we matter. I think society has programmed us to not see that our personal small wins matter. That they are great and should be rewarded. We are lead to believe that being 'Rich & Famous' is the best thing going. That we must keep up with the Jones' and deny what our heart and soul really want to do and be.

I have had my ups and downs, my good days and bad days, and I can tell you that I am not 100% sure where April went and what exactly I did with it. What I can tell you is that I have learned that right now, thats okay. It's okay that somedays I was lazy and had no motivation. It's okay that I got so frustrated with myself one night that I locked myself in the bathroom and took a long bath away from everyone. It's okay that I played silly games on my phone and scrolled through social media for more hours than I care to admit. It's also definitely okay that I laid in bed snuggling my dog and man for later in the morning than I had intended to because the comfort and love I felt was much needed.

You see all of that way MY process in adjusting and dealing with the new world that has been thrust on us all. My process and your process wont look the same and that's okay. What's truly important is acknowledging your feelings, accepting that you are in a process that simply wont be a straight line upwards.

Life this spring has been hard. I have struggled. We are all struggling, and that's okay. Your feelings are valid. Give yourself some more grace and a pat on the back for seeking to improve your emotional intelligence by acknowledging where you are today, understanding where you were yesterday, and choosing to work on yourself to love yourself that you might have a brighter tomorrow. It's a new month and I'm choosing to start fresh- creating better habits and a solid routine with self care, productivity, education, and leisure time. Will you join me?
