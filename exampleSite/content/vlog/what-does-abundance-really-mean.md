### Transcript of Video:

What do you think of when you hear the word abundance? Is it wealth? What about love? Or maybe food! Or are you more of an abundance of caution kind of person? I know, I know- you bankers gotta use that all the time. And an abundance of caution, well, it’s not always a bad thing. I definitely could have used that more than once in my life…when I didn’t.

Do you think you have abundance in life? Are you striving for abundance? I know I am! But what does that mean? What does that look like? How do we get there?

Hi, my name’s Amanda Mae Gray and I haven’t always had abundance in my life or really felt like really much of my adulthood had almost any abundance at all. My grandfather imparted on me this saying, famous amongst our family, that really ended up being my life. He said “If I didn’t have bad luck, I’d have no luck at all.” If I didn’t have Bad Luck, I’d have NO luck at all. It’s not exactly the positive kinda thing to live your life by and it certainly found its meaning in my life. Have you ever felt like that? Like just as things were getting good, WHAM! Something comes along and knocks you down. Takes you out.

Where can you find abundance in your life? You know to me, I’ve been in multiple car accidents, I’ve had multiple bad boyfriends horrible relationships, dishonest friends, and some terrible bosses. And it always seemed like I was on this rollercoaster ride. Where it was just slowly, growing and growing, and getting better, and making noise and getting up there. To reach the top with anticipation and excitement- only WHAM down and out and have everything dropped from under me in the fastest way possible with me completely out of control. Where I can do nothing. As my feet go up and over my head and I’m upside down I’m inside out and phew it comes to a stop. . . . . . I can barely catch my breath. Sigh…I thought we were getting somewhere.

Merriam-Webster defines abundance as affluence, wealth, and having plentifulness. Plentifulness. Those are great words but I really liked the synonyms better in the description- boatloads, oodles! I wanna have oodles of joy and fun and wealth! That sounds more exciting to me! But how do I not just keep going down and out despite the climbs to the top?

And finally with this pandemic I’ve had time to think cuz my job was taken away. You know I thought I was getting better, I had joined this cool club called Toastmasters, things were looking up! I felt really secure in my relationship. I was able to buy a brand new car December 31st 2019. It was amazing because if you don’t know I had struggled with $70,000 worth of debt by the time I was at the age of 22. And it took me almost that full 10 years to erase that debt, work my tail off, and build my credit score back up. I was feeling good! And then everything came crashing down. Money was no longer flowing in and I was getting anxious. What am I gonna do? File for unemployment and thankfully they passed the stimulus bill so that comes in and my unemployment gets approved and I’m feeling better about money. I’m not feeling so stressed about it. And I smile and I relax. And I appreciate what I was given. I saw that I was gonna be okay. And I had overcome a lot more things than simply losing a job which had nothing to do with my own fault. Which was probably the first time that actually happened to be quite frank and honest with you. And I’d always overcome before! I’m pretty resilient so I knew I was gonna be okay.

And just as I started to feel that way, just as it started to feel better… All of a sudden I felt, more abundant. And the Universe said “Good job. When you go fill up your tank at Kroger, here’s $0.90 off a gallon.” “What?! 90 cents?! On already low prices?!? That means it took $9.98 for me to fill my 15 gallon tank… holy crap!! Ahhh awesome! Thank you, now I really feel abundant!” Cuz friends, THAT’s, that’s abundance. It’s not about the amount of dollars you have in your bank account. It’s not. It’s about seeing what you have and appreciating it, and more will come. I felt, I felt an abundance of wealth by spending less than $10 to fill my tank. And that may sound silly to you, but where has something like that maybe showed up in your life?

I also found that being home all the time gave me an abundance of love. You know, I got this cute lil puppy dog and he’s super goofy and I got to spend all this time with him. We go running and hiking and walking and play and snuggle and he’s the cutest goofiest, most joyful little thing. And I’m so grateful for him. And I’m so grateful for my boyfriend and this house that we live in. And I know that THAT, that’s true abundance.

Open yourself up to the idea, that abundance isn’t just those dollars. Where do you have more abundance in your life that maybe you’ve taken for granted before? Where can you find it, and appreciate it, so that you will continue to cultivate.

Epicurus, a great Greek philosopher, I think he had it right. He said it is “Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.” It’s not about what we have, its about what we enjoy. Thats what makes us abundant. I love to laugh and have fun cuddle puppy dogs and be with supportive people. And I love to save a dollar where I can! Thank you bargain shopping, love it! I am abundant. I might not be a millionaire today- far from it! One day! Cuz if I don’t say that its definitely not going to happen. But I am still abundant and with knowing that, only more abundance can come into my life.
