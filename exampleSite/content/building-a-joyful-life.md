##### What brings you joy? How do you find motivation? What inspires you?

These questions are often asked yet difficult to answer truly. They seem so simple yet admitting the true deep down feelings can be so hard. I think we relate these things to goals, milestones, and set things that happen one time rather than realizing that our life is a journey and a process that we continually work on and have to choose to put effort into.

We forget to embrace the small moments and wins and really give ourselves credit for them. To understand and appreciate that we will have emotional ups and downs and that when we are having those downs we need must embrace them. Accept them for what they are and remember that they do not define us. We will be alright.

We tend to judge ourselves so harshly in these moments rather than accept them for what they are- the ebb and flow of life. Without the downs do we truly appreciate the ups? Without challenge do we ever have that amazing feeling of growth and accomplishment?

The true challenge of life is being conscious to this and in those moments acknowledging them. Taking a deep breath and admitting where we are, what we are feeling, and how it is okay to be in this place right now. When this happens give yourself grace. Think of something good in your life that you are grateful for that makes you smile no matter how small that may be.

I am grateful for my dog who makes me laugh, shake my head, and feel loved every day. What are you grateful for today? Journal about it now- get in on paper. Then reread your words and come back to it when needed.

I am so happy you are here and know we can build a joyful life together! \~AMG
