#### Let's Get Acquainted!

Thanks for coming by to check me out- I'm excited to share this journey with you!

I have had laugh lines since I was 16- laughter and joy have always been a big part of my life. No matter the situation, I find myself always trying to get others to smile and laugh. Growing up I tried everything I could from singing and dancing, to rock climbing and canoeing, to French club and math club, yet always found the most joy in making others smile. This didn't lead me to a clear career path however.

My adulthood hasn't always been the thing of sunshine and to this day I still struggle with feeling lost at times. Bad romantic relationships, unhealthy friendships, mountains of debt and a shredded credit score, and struggling to stay afloat financially and emotionally plagued me despite my attempts to gloss it all over with a happy persona online and out socially. Working multiple jobs, being taken advantage of by those close to me, and having multiple car accidents I felt like I could never catch a break. I'd often think back to my grandfather's saying "If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all!"

I simply wanted a happy life with meaning. I wished on many occasion I could just shake a crystal ball and be told what I was supposed to do with my life, who I was supposed to be. I was so good at looking at other peoples problems and knowing how to solve them yet was frustrated as hell that I couldn't figure out what I wanted. Nothing quite fit. Not sales, nor acting, comedy, or bartending. Yet with everything I kept talking and listening and surprising myself when someone would comment on how I made them smile or laugh. How I had great energy and they wished the world had more people like me.

How could someone so internally frustrated and discontent be able to make so many strangers happy even for just a moment? All I wanted was to be happy in my daily life while making an impact in the world which is how I was lead to this. I don't have all the answers and I'm not perfect. I'm a struggling human who wants love and acceptance like everyone else. But I am a leader and I am inspired that everyone can have a life they want that is full of joy and I am here to help you figure that out for yourself.

I am here hoping to offer wisdom and guidance. To make you laugh and smile and encourage you to stand up for yourself and embrace what brings you joy. You are amazing and oh so talented and owe it to yourself and the world to share that, hone it, and build your life full of joy! Let's do it together and make the world a happier place- even just one joke at a time!

Keep smiling- you got this!
